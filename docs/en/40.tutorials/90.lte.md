## Sample Introduction
To meet the needs of long-distance working using drones, for example, works in the area of Surveying, Inspection, and Security, MSDK provides the LTE function, which enhances the transmission process and ensures image transmission stability. When the image transmission signal is weak, 4G transmission will be opened automatically and enter the enhanced mode, which means Ocusync transmission and 4G transmission will work together. When the image transmission is disconnected, the 4G transmission will work alone.

LTE function provides authenticating, getting the authentication verification code, updating the authentication information, setting the enhanced transmission type, adding listeners to the LTE authentication information, LTE link information, Dongle information, and so on.


Through the LTE Sample, users can see the display of LTE authentication information, LTE link state, and Dongle information of drones and remote controller. The complete authentication process can be experienced, getting the authentication verification code, starting authentication, calling back and displaying the authentication result, and updating the information when the information has not been received. And user can also set the LTE link type and see the authentication result calling back and displaying.

**Note: LTE functionality is currently only available in mainland China. LTE function can not be used if the LDM is opened.**


## Interface Calling Process
The following figure shows a complete interface display and an example of the interface calling process. For detailed usage, please check the LTE management class [ILTEManager](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/ILTEManager/ILTEManager.html)ã€‚

> **Notice:**
>
> * The default expiration time of LTE authentication is **30 days**. If the expiration time has arrived, the `isLTEAuthenticated()` will be "False".
> * For LTE  authentication information, please refer to `LTEAuthenticationInfo()`. For LTE link information, please refer to `LTELinkInfo()`. For Dongle state information, please refer to `WlmDongleInfo()`.
