## Sample Introduction

MSDK provides firmware upgrade inform function, which is used to monitor the upgradeable firmware information of the device module. When upgradeable information has been monitored, the type of upgradeable module, the current firmware information, the latest firmware information and the status of whether the module can be upgraded can be obtained through interfaces.

Currently, MSDK does not provide firmware upgrade function, users should upgrade the firmware through the DJI official App.

## Interface Calling Process

The following figure shows a complete interface display and an example of the interface calling process. For detailed usage, please check the firmware upgrade management class [IUpgradeManager]().
