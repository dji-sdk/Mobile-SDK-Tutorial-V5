## Sample Introduction

The MSDK firmware upgrade function allows listening of connected and upgradeable components, such as remote controllers and aircraft modules. Upon obtaining upgradeable information, developers can call `getUpgradeableComponents()` to retrieve a list of all upgradeable components, including component type, upgradeable state, current firmware information, and the latest firmware information. If a newer firmware version is available for an upgradeable component, developers can either upgrade online through the DJI official app or perform an offline upgrade by calling `startOfflineUpgrade()`. The upgrade process can be listened.

## Interface Calling Process

The figure below illustrates a complete interface call example. Call interfaces according to the actual scenario. For more information, refer to the firmware upgrade management class [IUpgradeManager](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/IUpgradeManager/IUpgradeManager.html) in the MSDK API documentation and sample code.

* Consistent upgrades are currently not supported.
* If developers opt for an offline upgrade, they should download the **offline firmware package** for their target product from the DJI official website and provide the package storage path. For example, [the package of M300 RTK](https://www.dji.com/au/matrice-300/downloads?site=brandsite&from=insite_search)
* The `checkUpgradeableComponents()` interface is used to request the latest firmware version information from the server but is not introduced at the interface calling process.
