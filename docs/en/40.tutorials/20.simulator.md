## Sample Introduction
The Mobile SDK Simulator function is an important function to test various flight states in the form of a simulator, which avoids the trouble of developers having to conduct on-the-spot flight tests, and can greatly reduce the development threshold and development cost. 

This sample shows the complete interfaces and an example of the interface calling process.


## Interface Calling Process

The following figure shows a complete interface display and an example of the interface calling process. By calling the interface, the behavior of opening the simulator, closing the simulator, and monitoring the flight status returned by the simulator can be realized uniformly for all models. For detailed usage, please check the [API documentation](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/ISimulatorManager/ISimulatorManager.html) of Mobile SDK.
