## Sample Introduction
The KeyManager class provides a set of methods to access the parameters of the hardware module and control the behavior of the hardware module, including DJIKey Value setting, Value acquisition, Value monitoring, and Action execution. The DJIKey instance can be created more conveniently through the createKey method provided by the KeyTools class.


## Interface Calling Process

The following figure shows the calling process of using the KeyManager interface to determine that the flight controller is connected normally and the GPS signal level is greater than or equal to level 2, then setting the home point for the aircraft, and finally executing the return operation. For detailed usage, please check the [API documentation](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/IKeyManager/IKeyManager.html) of Mobile SDK.
