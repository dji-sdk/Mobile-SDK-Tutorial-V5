## Sample Introduction
Taking photos and recording is an important function of the drone. And the management of media files like photos and videos is necessary. Management behavior includes accessing the media file storage resource of the drone, obtaining the media file list and list status, video file playing, and so on.

This sample shows the complete interfaces and an example of the interface calling process.
