## Sample Introduction

RTK (Real-time Kinematic) is a common global positioning measurement method and can provide centimeter-level positioning accuracy. RTK Sample contains RTK Station and Network RTK (custom Network RTK, Chihiro Network RTK, CMCC Network RTK).

* RTK Station: The mobile station differentially processes the observation data returned by the base station and GPS to obtain accurate positioning results.
* Network RTK: The network is formed by the combination of multiple base stations, data processing center and communication lines. The base station collects the observation data in real-time and uploads the data to data processing center through communication lines. Data processing center tran transmits the error information to the mobile station, and the mobile station obtains accurate positioning results according to the error information.

This sample shows the complete interface and an example of the interface calling process.


## Interface Calling Process
The following figure shows a complete interface display and an example of the interface calling process. For detailed usage, please check the [API documentation](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/IRTKCenter/IRTKCenter.html) of Mobile SDK.

### IRTKCenter
[IRTKCenter](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/IRTKCenter/IRTKCenter.html) is RTK management class, which is used to get instances of network RTK and base station RTK. It provides the functions like the initialization and usage of custom network RTK, Chihiro network RTK and CMCC Network RTK. And it also provides the connection and setting of base station RTK.

### RTK Station
[IRTKStationManager](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/IRTKCenter/IRTKStationManager.html) is a class that manages the RTK base station, which is used to connect and configure the [DJI DRTK-2 base station](https://www.dji.com/d-rtk-2?site=brandsite&from=insite_search).

### Network RTK
[INetworkRTKManager](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/IRTKCenter/INetworkRTKManager.html) is a class that manages custom network RTK, Chihiro network RTK and CMCC Network RTK, which is used to initialize and enable the network RTK service.
