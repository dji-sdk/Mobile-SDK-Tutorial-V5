## Sample Introduction
The flight record module is to provide users with a way to determine responsibility and locate problems. If the user's drone is lost and the flight control log of the drone cannot be obtained, the flight records saved on the App can be analyzed.


## Interface Calling Process
The two interfaces used by the flight record module are:
* Get the path to store flight logs: getFlightRecordPath()
* Get the path of the flight controller compressed log: getFlyCLogPath()
There is no obvious calling process relationship. For detailed usage, please check the [API documentation](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/IFlightLogManager/IFlightLogManager.html) of Mobile SDK.
