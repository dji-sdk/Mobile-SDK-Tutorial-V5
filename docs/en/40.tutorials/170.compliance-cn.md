## Sample Introduction

In compliance with China's Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Flight Management Regulations, starting from January 1, 2024, any aircraft purchased and activated after this date must be registered under real-name in the UOM system for flights within Mainland China. The real-name registration information must be updated to the aircraft, otherwise the aircraft will not be able to take off normally. Therefore, developers in Mainland China must ensure that their aircraft are registered on the [CAAC UOM system](https://uom.caac.gov.cn/#/login) and develop real-name authentication function in MSDK projects.

## Interface Calling Process

The following figure shows a complete interface display and an example of the interface calling process. For detailed usage, please check the Aircraft System Remote Identification Management Class [IUASRemoteIDManager](https://developer.dji.com/cn/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/IUASRemoteIDManager/IUASRemoteIDManager.html) in the Mobile SDK API documentation.
