## Sample Introduction

MSDK perception module can realize perception management. The perception module provides sub switches of specified direction(upward, downward, horizontal direction), ability of vision positioning, and ability of precision landing. And perception module can change the type of obstacle avoidance, the braking distance of specified direction, and the warning distance of specified direction. Through the perception module, developers can start the adaptation, expansion, and maintenance of perception function more easily. 


## Interface Calling Process

For detailed usage, please refer to the perception management class [IPerceptionManager](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/IPerceptionManager/IPerceptionManager.html) of MSDK API documentation.

> **Note:** In the process diagram, the interface called and the calling order of the interface are only for reference, please check the sample code for details.
