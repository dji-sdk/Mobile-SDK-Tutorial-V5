## Sample Introduction

The SDK interconnection function enables communication between MSDK and PSDK devices, facilitating data reading and writing through pipelines. Developers need to call the MSDK API and ensure that the pipeline information, such as the pipeline ID and transmission control type, matches the corresponding PSDK device for a successful connection. Developers can also call the API or set a monitor to obtain a list of connected pipelines, returning the Pipeline() class. If a monitor is set in advance, connecting or disconnecting the pipeline triggers the monitor.

For more information about PSDK, please refer to [SDK Interconnection](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/function-set/advanced-function/sdk-interconnection.html).

## Interface Calling Process

The figure below illustrates a complete interface call example. Call interfaces according to the actual scenario. For more details, refer to the SDK interconnection management class [IPipelineManager](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/IUpgradeManager/IUpgradeManager.html) in the MSDK API documentation and sample code.

* The pipeline ID is determined by the device manufacturer. Different devices have unique `pipelineId`.
* When reading and writing data through pipelines, the upward (remote controller to aircraft) transmission speed ranges from 8 to 24 KB/s, while the downward (aircraft to remote controller) transmission speed ranges from 2 to 3 MB/s.
* For error message of reading and writing data through pipelines, please refer to `DJIPipeLineError`.
* Pipeline transmission control types can be divided into stable transmission and unstable transmission. The stable transmission ensures no package loss, while the unstable transmission can speed up the transmission.
