## Sample Introduction

Waypoint mission management is an important function used for autonomous drone operation. Through the provided MSDK API, we can upload, execute, pause, resume the waypoint mission, and set the listener of the waypoint mission execution state and the wayline information.    

We define the waypoint mission in the waypoint files, which follows the DJI WayPoint Markup Language Standard. The waypoint file is zip file ended by `.zip`. The file structure of waypoint file is shown below:
```c
waypoints_name.kmz
└── wpmz
  ├── res
  ├── template.kml
  └── waylines.wpml 
```
The `template.kml` is the template file. The `waylines.wpml` is the execution file. The `res` is the resource file. For precise introduction, please refer to [DJI WPML](https://developer.dji.com/doc/cloud-api-tutorial/en/specification/dji-wpml/overview.html). There are introductions of `template.kml`, `waylines.wpml`, and common elements, which will help you with the waypoint file writing.



## Interface Calling Process

The following figure shows a complete interface display and an example of the interface calling process. For detailed usage, please check the [IWaypointMissionManager](https://developer.dji.com/api-reference-v5/android-api/Components/IWaypointMissionManager/IWaypointMissionManager.html) of MSDK API Documentation. The contents of the dotted box are optional interfaces.
