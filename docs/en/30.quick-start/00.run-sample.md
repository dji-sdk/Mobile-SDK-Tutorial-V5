This guide assumes you are using Android Studio Bumblebee 2021.1.1 and above. 

## Register as a DJI Developer

Register for a DJI Developer account <a href="https://account.dji.com/register?appId=dji_sdk&backUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.dji.com%2Fuser&locale=en_US" target="_blank">here</a>.

During the registration process, email information and a credit card or phone number will need to be supplied to verify the registration. Any credit card information given will only be used for verification and will not be charged.


## Generate an App Key

Every application needs a unique App Key to initialize the SDK.

To create an App Key for an application:

Go to the DJI developer <a href="https://developer.dji.com/user" target="_blank">Developer Center</a>

1. Select the "Apps" tab on the left.
2. Select the "CREATE APP" button on the right.
3. Enter the App Type, APP Name, Software Platform, Packeage Name, and the other informations by yourself. For compiling different target App (all product App, aircraft App or handheld App), you need to use different `Package Name`, which can refer to the "applicationId" in file `build.gradle`.
    * sample-app-all：Compile all product App. `Package Name` use **com.dji.sampleV5.all**
    * sample-app-aircraft：Compile aircraft App. `Package Name` use **com.dji.sampleV5.aircraft**
    * sample-app-handheld：Compile handheld App. `Package Name` use **com.dji.sampleV5.handheld**
4. An application activation email will be sent to complete App Key generation. User go back to the developer center after the successful activation, and the App Key is generated. You need to copy and paste the App Key into the application.


## Android Sample App

The SDK doesn't need to be downloaded to run the Android sample application as it's already included in the project.

#### Android Sample Code Setting 

1. Download or clone the MSDK Android sample project from Github: <a href="https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-Android-V5" target="_blank">https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-Android-V5</a>。

2. Our sample project has packaged the setting. Open the sample project at Android Studio, you can fill the generated "App Key" string into file "gradle.properties". Based on the target App type (all product App, aircraft App or handheld App), you should replace corresponding App Key. Take the figure for example.

#### Run the Sample App

Take the M30 Series for example, compile and install the sample code into the M30 Series remote controller (ie DJI RC Plus), and then connect the DJI RC Plus to the M30 Series aircraft to run the sample application. 


Before the usage, permissions are in need. The following are the range of permission.
* Permissions for SDK
  ```c
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.KILL_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
  ```

* Permissions for sample modules<br/>app for all, app for handheld, app for aircraft. The permissions for this three modules are the same.
  ```c
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
  ```

* permissions for uxsdk
  ```c
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
  ```


Press to check [precise meaning of permissions](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission).



If the words "Registration Status: Registered" appear in the upper left corner of the main interface of the Sample, the sample code is running successfully, and "Product Name: M30_SERIES" appears, indicating that the MSDK is successfully connected to the aircraft. The following figure shows the flow chart of the SDK Manager API call.

> **Notice:**
>
> **When starting a third-party App based on MSDK on the remote controller(DJI RC Plus) that matching M30 series aircraft, official app DJI Pilot should be forcibly exited from the application and notification interface under the DJI RC Plus remote controller system settings interface to ensure a normal start of the third-party app.**
