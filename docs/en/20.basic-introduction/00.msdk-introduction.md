The DJI Mobile SDK is a software development kit designed to give developers access to the capability of DJI's aircraft and handheld camera products. The SDK simplifies the application development process by taking care of lower-level functionality such as flight stabilization, battery management, signal transmission, and communication. This way, the developer does not require a background in robotics or embedded systems and can instead focus on the application the DJI product is being integrated into.

The SDK includes:

* a library/framework that can be imported into an Android app that gives access to the DJI product
* an aircraft simulator and visualization tool
* sample code and tutorials
* this developer guide and API documentation

This introduction will describe how the SDK connects to the products, what functionality the SDK provides, and the basic architecture of the SDK.

## Feature Overview

Many of DJI's product features and capabilities are accessible to developers through the SDK. Developers can automate flight, control the camera and gimbal, receive real-time video and sensor data, download saved media from the product, and monitor the state of the other components.

### Flight Control

The DJI Mobile SDK allows three ways to control aircraft flight:

* **Manually**: User pilots aircraft with the remote controller while SDK allows monitoring live video and sensor data. 
* **Virtual Stick Commands**: SDK allows the generation of remote controller sticks movements virtually, simulating a pilot.
* **Missions**: Convenient, easy to implement high-level control of the aircraft. For example, defined flight paths can be executed with a Waypoint mission.

Virtual stick commands and missions allow simple but powerful automated flight control of DJI aircraft. 

### Camera

The functions of both the camera and the gimbal support setting parameters or performing actions through the corresponding interfaces

* **Camera mode**: Video recording mode and still image capture mode
* **Exposure**: Shutter, ISO, aperture, and exposure compensation are all available to customize for maximum flexibility
* **Image Parameters**: Aspect ratio, contrast, hue, sharpness, saturation, and filters
* **Video Parameters**: Resolution and frame rate
* **Camera orientation**: When the camera is installed on the gimbal, the orientation of the camera can be controlled through the interface

### Live Video

The live video broadcast by the aircraft of the main camera feed is available through the DJI Mobile SDK. Live video is available even when the camera is capturing images or video to its storage media.


### Sensor Data

Rich sensor data is available through the SDK. GPS position, compass, barometer, flight velocity, and altitude are some of the sensor readings available at up to 10 Hz through the Mobile SDK. 

### Download Media

Videos saved to the camera's storage media (SD card or solid-state drive) are accessible to view and download through the DJI Mobile SDK. Both previews and full image data can be accessed.

### Remote Controller, Battery, Wireless Link

The remote controller, battery, and wireless link can all be accessed through the SDK. Mostly these components provide state information, but some control is also possible.

## Differences with Other SDKs

Most Android applications will either create, manipulate and/or visualize data. However, apps using the Mobile SDK can interact with the world around the user through DJI drones, so there is a fundamental difference.

* **Kinetic Energy**: An aircraft can have a mass of several kilograms and move at speeds of up to 20 m/s. While the ability to programmatically change position is tremendously powerful, it also means an application can potentially damage the product it is controlling, or the environment the product is being controlled in.
* **Share Space**: DJI's aircraft move in space shared by other people, structures, and aircraft. DJI provides a geofencing system to prevent aircraft from entering critical space, but developers and users must still understand the local national laws and regulations of the environment the aircraft moves in.
* **Highly Asynchronous**:  Wireless connectively can be unpredictable in challenging wireless environments. Sometimes it can take hundreds of milliseconds for a command to be transferred (assuming it ever does). While many developers are familiar with asynchronous programming techniques in networking, when commands aren't communicated on a robotic system, behavior in the physical world can be unexpected.

It is not possible as a developer to predict or programmatically assess the environment a user will operate in. An easy maneuver in an open environment can be difficult in a confined space. Environments can be dynamic and might be sometimes safe, and other times not. Therefore both developers and users must understand the capabilities and limitations of the products and their controlling applications.

## Connection to Application and Product

The following diagram illustrates how the DJI Mobile SDK fits into a mobile application, and how it is connected to a DJI aircraft.

A mobile application is built with the DJI Mobile SDK, the platform SDK (Android), and is run on the Mobile Device (for example Nexus phone, Nexus tablet, etc).

The mobile device connects to a DJI product either wirelessly with WiFi or through a USB cable depending on the product. For aircraft products, the mobile device connects to the remote controller, which connects wirelessly to the aircraft through another wireless link (for the Phantom 3 Standard, two wireless links connect the remote controller and aircraft). Detailed connectivity for each product is shown below.

Some products are only supported by MSDK 4. X, but not supported by MSDK V5. Therefore, depending on the product model, when the Mobile SDK sends a command to the drone, the command may go through multiple wireless links or cable connections.
